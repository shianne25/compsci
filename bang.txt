I awake with the black night
Everyone come in, who’s turn is it next?
It’s an unpredictible, crazy guerilla
Bow down in worship till your voice explodes
Switch up this loser atmosphere
So they can’t hide this insanity
The dignity of men, the pretense of women
It’s interesting to see this kind of unknown confidence
As if I’m showing off,
I shamelessly dig into your body like an allergy
Swarming around in a strange mind
Today, this place is lawless

I’ll set this place on fire, to burn up your heart
I wanna make you go crazy
B.I.G Yea we bang like this, everyone together

Like you’ve been shot

BANG! BANG! BANG!
BANG! BANG! BANG!
Bang bang bang
BANG! BANG! BANG!
BANG! BANG! BANG!
Bang bang bang

Nobody move, nobody move
Nobody move, nobody move
Let’s see the end of this night, see the end
Let’s see the end of this night
Bang bang bang

I’ll take you away right now
When the red sky dances
We’re spinning and spinning, you and I, this place
is Valhalla – Give praise and spread it out louder

We go hard, we’re the night’s watchmen,
run all night with space magic
This song is the apex, it’s so fun, sing about the wonder
Loud screams are devilish melodies,
the connection to a black poison
All around you, get high and release the reins whoo

I’ll set this place on fire, to burn up your heart
I wanna make you go crazy
B.I.G Yea we bang like this, everyone together

Like you’ve been shot

BANG! BANG! BANG!
BANG! BANG! BANG!
Bang bang bang
BANG! BANG! BANG!
BANG! BANG! BANG!
Bang bang bang

Nobody move, nobody move
Nobody move, nobody move
Let’s see the end of this night, see the end
Let’s see the end of this night
Bang bang bang

Ready or not
Yea we don’t give a what
Ready or not
Yea we don’t give a what

Let’s go, guys go on top
Girls get low
Pull the trigger, bang bang bang
let the bass drum go

Guys go on top
Girls get low
Pull the trigger, bang bang bang
let the bass drum go
