Th-th-the best

Oh my god

Whoever looks at me can see I’m kind of a killer, alright
This body is second to no one, alright

You’re following behind me
But I’m only running forward
I jump on top of the table
You’re sitting at I don’t care

If you touch me you won’t be able to handle it
I’m hot hot hot hot fire
Before I flip something over
Please can someone stop me

I open my closet and, put on the freshest outfit
The reflection of my face in the mirror, I carefully check it over
Right now it’s 8, I’m supposed to meet up at 8:30
Tonight I set out with bold steps

I am the best
I am the best
I am the best
I am the best
Th-th-the best

Whoever looks at me can see I’m kind of fabulous, alright
Even if you were me, you’d be envious of this body, alright

Guys are turning around to look at me
Girls are following me
Being looked down on in the spot
I’m sitting at, every day is tiring

Pretending to be an athlete, this snobby
Clumsy playa
Like you’re a flat tire
I’ll dump you good for people to see

I refuse to be compared, I’m telling you the truth
If we’re talking about my value, I’m a billion dollar baby
People who know a thing or two, they all know it so ask them
Grab anyone and ask them who is the best

I am the best
I am the best
I am the best
I am the best
Th-th-the best

Who? You are better than me?
No no no no na na na na
Who? You are better than me?
No no no no na na na na
Who? You are better than me?
No no no no na na na na
Who? You are better than me?
No no no no na na na na
