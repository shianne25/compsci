Ayo, GG!
Yeah yeah, shall we start?
OMG! Look at her, look
What happened to her that she cut her hair, huh?
OMG! Again look at her
From head to toe, her style has changed
Why did she do that? I’m curious to death
Why did she do that? Tell me
Hahaha! Eh let me introduce myself
Here comes trouble, whoo! Follow us

Oh oh oh eh oh (Eh eh eh eh)
Oh oh eh oh oh oh oh oh
You really are something else

Who is she? Ridiculous
Do you know you’re too self-assertive?
She thinks I’m average
I guess she really liked him!
No way! No way!

She became so pretty and sexy
It’s because of him, right?
I almost asked her
What her new makeup was

Truthfully, I’ve seen it for the first time
The deep eyes, like a scarred beast
I was dizzy by just talking to him
You really are something else
You really are something else

Oh oh oh eh oh
(Here comes trouble, hey girl listen)
Oh oh eh oh oh oh oh oh
You really are something else
Oh oh oh eh oh (Hey)
Oh oh eh oh oh oh oh oh (Nananana hey)
You really are something else

Ayo stop! Let me put it down another way

I got a boy a cool one, I got a boy a kind one
I got a boy handsome boy who took all my heart
I got a boy a cool one, I got a boy a kind one
I got a boy awesome boy guess I’ve fallen for him

Ah, my prince
When are you gonna come save me?
Like a white dream
Will you lift me in your arms and fly?

I’m in panic
He wants to see my bare face
I really like him
Would it be okay to show it to him?
Oh, never (That’s right, that’s right)
Let’s keep what needs to be kept (Right, right)
Until you get all of his heart
Don’t ever forget this

Oh oh oh eh oh, oh oh eh oh
Even if I stay up all night, it’s not enough
Oh oh oh eh oh, oh oh eh oh
He’s our biggest interest

Listen to me, you all know him, right?
He’s a bit young but he’s full inside
Sometimes he is as reliable as an oppa
But when he does aegyo, he is so cute

Oh oh oh eh oh, oh oh eh oh oh oh
You’re crazy, crazy
Oh oh oh eh oh, oh oh eh oh oh oh
You’re crazy, crazy

I’m really angry
My boy doesn’t look at me as a girl
What should I do when I feel hopeless?
Should I make him feel jealous? What do I do?
No way! No way!

Don’t stop! Let’s bring it back to 1:40
