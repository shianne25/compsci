You know it’s been a long day
I haven’t seen you today
You’re somewhere
I’m sure
(Woo oh yeah, hey yeah)

I know that you’re looking at me
More than anyone
But I just want to keep teasing you
No, what am I doing?
I should just take you in
I’m not playing hard-to-get but boys will be boys
Watch out, watch out, watch out

Woo- Ah It won’t be easy
Woo- Ah Quite many secrets
I don’t want to pass my love on to you so easily
Woo- Ah Because I’m special
Woo- Ah Because I’m that pretty girl
Tell me, show me, make you more anxious

Say hi hi hi hi,
make me say hi
Take me high high high high,
take me even higher
In the dreams, love love love love,
make it pound and pound (it’s true)
A little bit more (someday)
Try harder (oh yeah)
It shouldn’t be so easy Love is supposed to be cruel

Text me, more often, tell me that sweet story
Then I will, once or twice a day
I’m being more egoistic than i have ever been
It’s you, yeah

I love you, I want to look at only you
Don’t you want to hear me say that?
Just wait a little bit, some more
Making you even more anxious

Woo- Ah Even when I don’t say anything
Woo- Ah Please don’t ask
I get quite a bit shy sometimes, that’s all

Woo- Ah I get worried
Woo- Ah That you might get tired of it
And also that you might find out about my real feelings

Say hi hi hi hi,
make me say hi
Take me high high high high,
take me even higher
In the dreams, love love love love,
make it pound and pound (it’s true)
Little bit more (someday)
Try harder (oh yeah)
Love is even more cruel than college entrance exams

I actually like you everything about you
But I worry (Whoah)
Long-waited love If that’s really you
I need just a little bit more time
Let me see you

[YJ/GW] Sweet to sweet Sweet and sour
[YJ/GW] Spicy so spicy Spicy and sour
[YJ/GW] Fresh so fresh Fresh and spicy
It makes me dizzy

Take me high high high high,
I love this feeling
My heart is pounding (so bad)
What should I do (oh yeah)
My heart is all excited, getting excited, what should i do

High High High High High High High
High High High High
Like gimbap, you’re like dumplings, so sweet
