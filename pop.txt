(Pop pop pop)
(Let’s start) The way I want to play it
(Won’t stop) C’mon up and shake it
You know? Just remember you are in my hands

The twitch in your eyes, your nervous gestures Baby
I want to pop you

Before the fluttering stops
I wanna make it
Pop pop pop, you want it

Just relax and check it
Go ahead and take it
