STAYC girls it’s going down

It’s not like yeah
I’ve lost my mind, rush outside
Hurry up yeah
With a different than normal drink in hand,
my heart is pounding
Don’t stop me

Just sweetness isn’t enough
The excitement that’s spreading,
Give me more
That unstoppable feeling
This is what I’m looking for
3, 2, 1, go

I want to make it bubbly
Your unchanging heart
It just depends on you
Restraint is a no no no
Come on, like the faint, fleeting carbonation
Burst out, popping popping love yeah

Perfectly clear transparency
The reflected future, no pain no gain
The unbending ray of my light
Yeah, if I head towards it, I’ll be alright

Even love and friendship
It’s okay not to overdo it
because I want to stay like this

This sudden feeling that naturally popped up
Don’t try to bargain
Always go with the flow
There’s no meaning in copying someone else
I only know who I am

Like a bubble, I won’t disappear
Melted expectations are overflowing now
Each and every time it opens
I can hear it
The sparkling sound of my mind
